    <p id="maria">I do get some pleasure out of the Barbie movies, and the 12 Dancing Princesses is no exception. The animation is mostly full of lovely colour, fluid backgrounds and nuanced facial expressions. True, the animation in the dance sequences is not very inspired, but none of it is bad as far I could see. The music is whimsical and catchy, the dialogue is decent with some fun moments even with some corniness, the story has a lot of charm and heart making an existing story fresh in terms of storytelling and while the characters are not much different from the types of characters from the previous Barbie movies they are likable still. The voice acting is solid from all involved. Overall, a very charming movie.</p>

    <p id="hasti">The Twelve Dancing Princesses is a story about a king who has 12 daughters. The girls all sleep in the same room and each night when they go to bed, the doors are shut and locked until morning, yet every morning their shoes are worn through as though they had been dancing all night.</p>
